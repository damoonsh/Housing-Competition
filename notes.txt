Data preprocessing:

	General strategy: 
		Using features that are not missing*[1] to impute the missing data with 
		an algorithm. 

		NOTE[1]: Given that there are small fraction of missing values in the a feature
		, we can first impute that by filling it with mean or mode.

		K-means clustering:
			x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 are the features where x5 has missing values
			now there is going to be a k-means ran on each of the features x1-4
			hence each data point in each feature will be assigned a group and we 
			are interested in that group's average. Then in order to predict the
			value of the missing data, each feature will have a weight and a linear
			-wise calculation will indicate the missing value:
			1. Running k-means on each x1-4 feature (non-missing) and obtaining
			   each of their averages.
			2. Going over the missing value point where x5(i) is missing but we have
			   x1-4(i) values, and we also know the features correlation with each other
			   (with .corr() functionality) which will be called w15,w25,w35,w45 then we
			   know the average of each group that each data point features are in g1,g2,
			   g3,g4, hence: x5(i) = w15 * g1 + ... + w45 * g4

			   g denotes the average of that cluster,
			   w denotes weights where w15 = rel15 / (rel15 + ... + rel45)


		KNN:
			This procedure is relied on the y (independent) feature, where
			the dataframe is broken into dataframes with indexes with na's and
			non-nas, then the knn algorithm is ran on it.
# Implement:
	- Drop the ID column in the dataframe
	- Try out PCA
    - Implement the class for knn imptation
    
# Fixes:
